# ssis-training
This repository contains the exerices for a SQL Server Integration Services training as developed by Koos van Strien.

At this moment (2018-04-03) the course is aimed at SSIS 2016 (although most versions from 2012 on will do fine). You're expected to have AdventureWorks2016 as well as an empty version of AdventureWorksDW2016 (slightly modified).
