# Lab 09

Lab 9 isn't so much an assignment as the previous labs, but more an exploration of Biml

## Materials

We explored some training material from BimlScript.com - more precisely:

* [What is Biml?](http://www.bimlscript.com/walkthrough/Details/3105)
* [Biml Tools](http://www.bimlscript.com/walkthrough/Details/3107)
* [Introduction to XML](http://www.bimlscript.com/walkthrough/Details/3109)
* [Biml Basics](http://www.bimlscript.com/walkthrough/Details/3110)
* [Biml Basics for SSIS](http://www.bimlscript.com/walkthrough/Details/3112)
* [C# primer](http://www.bimlscript.com/walkthrough/Details/3117)
* [Introduction to BimlScript](http://www.bimlscript.com/walkthrough/Details/3115)

## Description

* Re-build exercise 3 of lab 1 using Biml. To do this, it might be handy to just open the solution for exercise 3, and create your Biml in the same project. This makes it easy to compare outcomes.
